# Agentic Sandbox - Project Notes

## Project Overview

**Agentic Sandbox** is a Docker-based development environment that provides a unified sandbox for running multiple AI coding assistants. It supports four major AI CLI tools:

- **Claude Code** (Anthropic) - `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- **Codex** (OpenAI) - `@openai/codex`
- **Gemini CLI** (Google) - `@google/gemini-cli`
- **OpenCode** (Anomalyco) - `opencode`

The project enables developers to experiment with and compare different AI coding assistants in an isolated, reproducible environment.

## Architecture

### Docker Container

The sandbox runs on `node:25` base image with all AI CLI tools pre-installed:

- `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest` (npm)
- `@openai/codex@latest` (npm)
- `@google/gemini-cli@latest` (npm)
- `opencode` (GitHub releases)

### Volume Mounts

The container uses two volume mounts:
1. **Home directory** (`$HOME_DIR` → `/home/node`) - Persists AI tool configurations, credentials, and cache
2. **Project directory** (`$PROJECT_DIR` → `/home/node/project`) - The working directory for the AI agent

### Port Mapping

- Port `1455` is exposed for Codex (mapped to localhost only for security)

## Usage

### Building the Container

```bash
make build
# or
docker build -t tb0hdan/agentic-sandbox -f deployments/Dockerfile .
```

### Running AI Agents

```bash
# Run Claude Code
make claude

# Run OpenAI Codex
make codex

# Run Google Gemini CLI
make gemini

# Run OpenCode
make opencode
```

### Manual Execution

```bash
./bin/agent <claude|codex|gemini|opencode> <home_dir> <project_dir>
```

Default directories:
- `HOME_DIR`: `build/home`
- `PROJECT_DIR`: `build/home/project`

### Docker Compose (with MCP Services)

Run with Docker Compose to include MCP services (remote-debugger-mcp and wass-mcp):

```bash
# Start containers in background
cd deployments && docker compose up -d

# Or with specific agent type
AGENT_TYPE=codex docker compose up -d
AGENT_TYPE=gemini docker compose up -d
AGENT_TYPE=opencode docker compose up -d

# Attach to the agent container
cd .. && bin/agent-docker

# Stop containers
cd deployments && docker compose down
```

Environment variables:
- `AGENT_TYPE`: Select agent (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, or `opencode`). Default: `claude`
- `HOME_DIR`: Path to home directory. Default: `./home`
- `PROJECT_DIR`: Path to project directory. Default: `./home/project`

MCP services included:
- `tb0hdan/remote-debugger-mcp` - Remote debugging capabilities
- `tb0hdan/wass-mcp` - WASS MCP service

MCP provisioning:
- The `bin/agent-docker` script automatically provisions MCP servers on first run
- A marker file (`/home/node/.mcp_provisioned`) prevents re-provisioning on subsequent runs
- To re-provision, delete the marker file: `docker exec <container_id> rm /home/node/.mcp_provisioned`

MCP configuration locations by agent:
- **Claude**: `/home/node/project/.mcp.json`
- **Codex**: `/home/node/project/mcp.json`
- **Gemini**: `/home/node/.gemini/settings.json`
- **OpenCode**: `/home/node/project/opencode.json`

## Configuration Files

### AI Agent Instructions

All AI tools are configured to read `CLAUDE.md` for project instructions:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Primary instruction file
- `AGENTS.md` - Redirects to CLAUDE.md (for Codex compatibility)
- `GEMINI.md` - Redirects to CLAUDE.md (for Gemini compatibility)
- `OPENCODE.md` - Redirects to CLAUDE.md (for OpenCode compatibility)

This unified approach ensures consistent behavior across all AI assistants.

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed
- [x] Docker container with all three AI CLI tools
- [x] Unified agent launcher script (`bin/agent`)
- [x] Makefile targets for build and agent execution
- [x] Volume mount configuration for persistent state
- [x] Instruction files for all three AI tools
- [x] BSD 3-Clause license
- [x] Docker Compose with MCP services (remote-debugger-mcp, wass-mcp)

### Future Considerations
- [ ] Add health checks to Dockerfile
- [ ] Support for additional AI coding assistants
- [ ] Environment variable configuration for API keys
- [ ] Multiple project directory support
- [ ] Automated testing of agent functionality
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline for container builds

## Security Considerations

1. **Localhost-only port binding** - Port 1455 is bound to 127.0.0.1 to prevent external access
2. **Isolated environment** - Each agent runs in an isolated container
3. **Credential management** - Credentials are stored in the mounted home directory, not baked into the image

## Dependencies

- Docker
- Make (optional, for convenience targets)
- API keys for respective AI services (configured at runtime)
